This is a basic implementation of a simple bootloader.
This bootloader can be helpful for up and coming students learning assembly or taking a course in OS to learn about how a bootloader plays a part in the development of an OS.
You can download, run and modify this code as you desire. This code has extensive comments and resources to provide you with most of the information you might need.

To setup (linux) just clone this repository.

1-
Run 
``` make clean ``` and then ``` make ```.

2-
After this run 
``` chmod +x run.zsh ```

and then ```./run.zsh```.

If you do not have zsh downloaded and are running a simple terminal then, just change the name of from ``run.zsh`` to ``run.sh`` .
Then just run (2) with the "run.sh" instead.

NOTE: You will need to have NASM, QEMU and make installed for this to run smoothly.
